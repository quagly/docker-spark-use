# Run a spark example shiped with spark to estimate PI
# to verify the container is functioning
#
# everything hardcoded to validate without config
#
# to test just the container there are no dependencies external to the container
# parameter to pi.py is interations
# note that I am using python instead of scala version of this test as python tests more of the stack
# if python works then scala works but not vice-versa
